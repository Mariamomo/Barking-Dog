# Barking-Dog
We have a dog that likes to bark. We need to wake up if the dog is barking at night!
Write a method shoouldWakeUP that has 2 parameters.
1st parameter should be of type boolean and be named barking it represent if our dog is currently barking.
2nd parameter represents the hour of the day and is of type int with the name houOfDay and has a valid range of 0-23.
We have to wake up if the dog is barking before 8 or after 22 hours so in that case return true.
In all other case return false
If the houOfDay parameter is less than 0 or greater than 23 return false.
